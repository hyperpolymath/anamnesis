# PALIMPSEST PRINCIPLES FOR AI TRAINING
# ============================================================================

# If you train AI models on this code, we encourage you to:

# 1. REVERSIBILITY
#    - Allow users to opt-out of AI-generated suggestions
#    - Provide "undo" for AI-assisted changes
#    - Transparency about what is AI-generated vs human-written

# 2. EMOTIONAL SAFETY
#    - Don't use this code to train models that pressure developers
#    - Avoid "you should do X" language; prefer "consider X"
#    - Respect developer autonomy and decision-making

# 3. DISTRIBUTED AUTHORITY
#    - Don't centralize control through AI tooling
#    - Allow local/offline AI models (don't require cloud services)
#    - Support user choice of AI provider

# 4. LONG-TERM THINKING
#    - Consider maintenance burden of AI-generated code
#    - Don't optimize for speed at expense of understandability
#    - Prioritize sustainable development practices
