# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The Anamnesis project is committed to providing a **welcoming, safe, and harassment-free** environment for all contributors, regardless of:

- Experience level (newcomer to expert)
- Gender identity and expression
- Sexual orientation
- Disability (visible or invisible)
- Personal appearance
- Body size
- Race, ethnicity, nationality
- Age
- Religion (or lack thereof)
- Technology choices or opinions

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an **open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy** community.

## Compassionate Code Conduct Pledge (CCCP) Principles

This Code of Conduct is based on **CCCP (Compassionate Code Conduct Pledge)** principles, which prioritize:

###  1. **Emotional Safety Over Efficiency**

We value **people** over productivity. Code reviews, discussions, and decision-making should:
- Assume good faith
- Avoid aggressive or dismissive language
- Recognize that mistakes are learning opportunities
- Support experimentation without fear of ridicule

**Examples**:
- ✅ "This approach has a potential issue with X. Consider trying Y instead?"
- ❌ "This is wrong. Did you even read the docs?"

### 2. **Reversibility Over Irreversible Change**

We embrace **safe-to-fail** experimentation:
- Most decisions can be undone or iterated upon
- Feature branches protect main from experiments
- "Let's try it and see" is encouraged when stakes are low
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs) for important changes

**Reversibility Reduces Anxiety**: Knowing you can roll back makes it safer to contribute.

### 3. **Distributed Authority Over Centralized Control**

- Decisions are made by those doing the work (with maintainer guidance)
- Multiple perspectives are sought before major changes
- **TPCF (Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework)** enables graduated trust
- Maintainers facilitate, not dictate

### 4. **Long-term Thinking Over Short-term Gains**

- Sustainable pace > burnout-inducing sprints
- Maintainability > clever code
- Documentation debt is real debt
- We're building for years, not weeks

##  Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members
- **Celebrating contributions**, big and small
- **Assuming good intent** unless proven otherwise
- **Patience with newcomers** - we were all beginners once
- **Asking clarifying questions** instead of making assumptions
- **Using inclusive language** (e.g., "they" not "he", "folks" not "guys")

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- **Harassment**: Offensive comments related to protected characteristics, unwelcome sexual attention, stalking (physical or online), intimidation
- **Trolling**: Deliberately inflammatory, off-topic, or disruptive comments
- **Personal attacks**: Ad hominem arguments, name-calling, insults
- **Doxxing**: Publishing someone's private information without consent
- **Exclusionary jokes or language**: Sexist, racist, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory humor
- **Unwelcome sexual attention or advances**: Both physical and verbal
- **Sustained disruption**: Monopolizing discussions, repeatedly derailing conversations
- **Gatekeeping**: "You're not a real developer if...", "Real programmers use..."
- **Aggressive behavior**: Shouting (all caps), excessive profanity directed at individuals, threats

##  Emotional Temperature Monitoring

We recognize that **developer well-being matters**. If a discussion becomes heated:

### Self-Monitoring

Ask yourself:
- Am I feeling defensive or angry?
- Is my heart racing or am I tensing up?
- Would I say this to someone's face in a calm tone?

**If yes to any**: Take a break. Step away for 10 minutes, an hour, or a day. The code will still be there.

### Intervention

If you observe someone getting heated:
- **Gently suggest a break**: "This seems like a good time for a pause. Let's revisit in a few hours?"
- **Ask clarifying questions**: "Can you help me understand your concern?"
- **Redirect to shared goals**: "We both want X. Let's focus on how to get there."

### Cool-Down Period

For contentious PRs or discussions:
- 🔥 **24-hour rule**: If emotions run high, pause discussion for 24 hours
- 🧊 **Mediation**: Maintainers can request a mediator (neutral third party)
- ✋ **Lock threads**: Temporary lock to prevent escalation (rare, last resort)

##  Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:

- **In project spaces**: GitHub (issues, PRs, discussions), email, chat
- **Representing the project**: Conferences, social media, official events
- **Ambiguous cases**: Maintainers will use reasonable judgment

This Code of Conduct does NOT apply:
- Personal social media unrelated to the project
- Private conversations (unless reported by a participant)
